## CarND-Functional-Safety-P3
Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree - Functional Safety Project

***

## Project overview
This project consist on creating the documentation for the functional safety of a Lane Assistance system following - Functional safety : ISO 26262. ISO 26262 is an international standard for functional safety on electrical and/or electronic system in production automobiles defined by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). The Lane Assistance system is part of a Advanced Driver Assistance System(ADAS) with the following two functionalities:

Lane departure warning: When the driver drift toward the edge of the lane, the steering wheel vibrates to alert the driver.
Lane keeping assistance: When the driver drift toward the edge of the lane, the steering wheel is turned toward the center of the lane to keep the car on its current lane.

Document templates, architectural diagrams and guidance on how to approach the project are provided [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Functional-Safety-Project). 

The documentation consists on the following five documents:

1. Safety Plan
2. Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment
3. Functional Safety Concept
4. Technical Safety Concept
5. Software Requirements

Documents are created using Microsoft word and excel. And for easier review, printed version (PDF) is also prepared.
